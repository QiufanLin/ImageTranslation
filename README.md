# Galaxy Image Translation with Semi-supervised Noise-reconstructed Generative Adversarial Networks

In this work, we propose a two-way galaxy image translation model for that exploits both paired and unpaired images in a semi-supervised manner, and introduce a noise emulating module that is able to learn and reconstruct noise characterized by high-frequency features. We show that our model recovers global and local properties effectively. To our best knowledge, this work is the first attempt to apply semi-supervised methods and noise reconstruction techniques in astrophysical studies.


By experimenting on multi-band galaxy images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHT),
